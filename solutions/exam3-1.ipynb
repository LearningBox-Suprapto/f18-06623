The uncertainty is estimated by:\n\n$\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial k}^2 \\sigma_k^2 + \\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial C_{A0}}^2 \\sigma_{C_{A0}}^2 }$\n\nwith $\\sigma_k = 1e-4$ and $\\sigma_{C_{A0}} = 0.01$.\n\nTo evaluate those derivatives, we need a differentiable integrator. You can use this implementation of the trapezoid rule for that. You cannot use the quad function.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import autograd.numpy as np\n\ndef trapz(y, x):\n    d = np.diff(x)\n    return np.sum((y[0:-1] + y[1:]) * d / 2)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["First, use the equation above and the provided trapz function to find the time required to reach 90% conversion for this reactor.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Next, use the formula for $\\sigma_t$ to estimate the uncertainty in this time.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### solution\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This problem requires you to compute the derivatives of the integral function.
