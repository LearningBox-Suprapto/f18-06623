The most straightforward way is to define two functions for the activity coefficients with $n1$ as the argument. You have to specify the number of moles of $n2$ that are present. You can choose this number. Then, you just compute the desired derivatives, and show that they make the Gibbs-Duhem equation equal zero.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"# Out[14]:\n# text/plain\nTrue"}],"source":["import autograd.numpy as np\nfrom autograd import grad\nA12 = 2.1041\nA21 = 1.5555\n\nn2 = 1.0\n\ndef lng1(n1):\n    x1 = n1 / (n1 + n2)\n    x2 = 1 - x1\n    return A12 * ((A21 * x2) / (A12 * x1 + A21 * x2))**2\n\ndef lng2(n1):\n    x1 = n1 / (n1 + n2)\n    x2 = 1 - x1\n    return A21 * ((A12 * x1) / (A12 * x1 + A21 * x2))**2\n\ndlng1 = grad(lng1)\ndlng2 = grad(lng2)\n\nN1 = np.linspace(0, 2)\nX1 = N1 / (N1 + n2)\nX2 = 1 - X1\n\nGD = X1 * [dlng1(n1) for n1 in N1] + X2 * [dlng2(n1) for n1 in N1]\nnp.allclose(GD, np.zeros(GD.shape))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The final statement shows that the Gibbs-Duhem equation evaluates to zero for all values of $n1$ from 0 to 2 moles.\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":{},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
