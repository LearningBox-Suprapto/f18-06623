When the arguments to the function are integers, the following relation is true:\n\n$\\Gamma(n + 1) = n!$\n\nShow that this is true for the integers from 1 to 10. You can use the `math.factorial` function.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"# Out[87]:\n# text/plain\n24"}],"source":["from math import factorial\n\nfactorial(4)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### solution\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We just need to setup the equations and integrals and then iterate over the integers.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":":RESULTS:\n # Out[29]:\n # output\n 1 1.0000000000000002 1 True\n 2 0.9999999999999998 1 True\n 3 2.0 2 True\n 4 6.0 6 True\n 5 24.0 24 True\n 6 120.00000000000001 120 True\n 7 720.0000000000001 720 True\n 8 5040.000000000001 5040 True\n 9 40320.0 40320 True\n 10 362879.99999999994 362880 True\n\n :END:"}],"source":["from math import factorial\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef integrand(t, x):\n    return np.exp(-t) * t**(x - 1)\n\ndef Gamma(x):\n    I, err = quad(integrand, 0, np.inf, args=(x, ))\n    return I\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i, Gamma(i), factorial(i - 1), np.allclose(Gamma(i), factorial(i - 1)))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Within float tolerance, these are equal.\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":{},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
