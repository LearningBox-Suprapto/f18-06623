<li><b>Exam 1</b> will be held on <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2018-09-24 Mon]</span></span>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The problems will be available by 8:00 am on that day. I will send an
email that morning when they have been assigned.</li>
<li>This will be a 2 hour exam, on the honor system. You may start the exam any
time you want, but you should not take more than two hours to complete it,
and you must turn in your work after two hours. It is cheating to take more
than two hours without prior authorization.</li>
<li>We will not have class on 9/24. I strongly recommend you take the exam
during the normal class time at a location of your choosing.</li>
<li>All problems must be turned in at the latest 8:30pm on <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2018-09-24 Mon]</span></span>.</li>
<li>I will be in my office Monday morning until 10:20am, and then available
intermittently the rest of the day in my office or by email.</li>
