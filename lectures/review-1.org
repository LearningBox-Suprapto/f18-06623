* Summary of key concepts covered so far

** Numerical integration

Integration of numerical /data/

~numpy.trapz~

** Quadrature

Numeric integration of /functions/

~scipy.integrate.quad~

** Solutions to first-order differential equations

Numeric solutions to initial value, first-order differential equations.

~scipy.integrate.solve_ivp~

including systems of first-order differential equations, and n^{th} order differential equations that have been converted to systems of first-order differential equations.

- the use of event functions to identify x-values of features in the solution
  - where the solution is equal to something
  - where the derivatives are equal to something, e.g. minima and maxima
  - anything else that makes sense and can be computed from x, f(x) and f'(x)

** What have we not covered yet related to ODEs?

*** Stiff solvers

 Stiff ODEs are ones that have regions where the solution changes very fast, and regions where it changes very slow. The required step size for integration must be very small in the fast changing region, and this can make progress very slow in the slow moving regions. There are algorithms for dealing with stiff equations, and these are often studied in a numerical methods course. In this class, we take a more practical approach. If the default settings of ~solve_ivp~ work, we use them. If they don't, and we are sure the equations are correct, we try another solver.

The default solver in ~scipy.integrate.solve_ivp~ is the Runge-Kutta 4/5 algorithm. For the problems we have examined, it works fine, and it is unnecessary to improve on it until we look at problems where it does not work. When we do, all that is required is to change an argument to solve_ivp. You can change the solver with the optional ~method~ argument.

You can see from the docstring they recommend a similar approach:

*** Boundary value problems

 We have only considered initial value problems so far. Boundary value problems are those where conditions on the solution are provided at two or more different positions. Many methods to get solutions to these problems inevitably require solutions to linear or nonlinear equations, and we have not learned how to solve these yet. When we do, we will return to these problems.

* What is yet to come?

** Solving non-linear algebraic equations

This forms the foundation of solving many engineering problems at steady state, or where various driving forces have to be balanced. When we have learned how to solve coupled nonlinear algebraic equations, we will return to some classes of non-linear boundary value problems.

** Optimization

When we pose a problem that requires a solution to minimize or maximize something, we have posed an optimization problem. There are many classes of these problems, ranging from parameter estimation, to maximizing the yield of a reaction or profit on a process, to minimizing the cost of an operation. Since these problems are often nonlinear, this will come after we learn some basics of solving nonlinear equations.

** Nonlinear parameter estimation / regression

Model building, and estimation of the parameters in the models from experimental data is a core activity. We will spend some time learning how to do this, especially with uncertainty estimates.

** Solving linear algebraic equations

Many classes of engineering problems involve coupled linear equations. There are several methods for solving these that differ significantly from nonlinear equations that we will learn about. We will return to some classes of boundary value problems after this.

** Bringing it all together with machine learning

When you combine linear and nonlinear algebra with regression and optimization and data you get to what is called machine learning today.
