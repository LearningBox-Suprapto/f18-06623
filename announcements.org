- [2018-10-08 Mon 10:38] Update on bvp-1. Here is a correction for bvp-1.
  The flow of an incompressible fluid between two solid plates and driven by a pressure drop is given by:

  $\frac{d^2 v}{dy^2} = \frac{\Delta P}{\mu L}$

  where v(y) is the velocity in the flow direction (x) as a function of position
  between the plates. The fluid is glycerol with a viscosity $\mu = 0.9$ Pa-s.,
  the gap between the plates is 0.5 mm and the pressure drop $\frac{\Delta
  P}{L}$ is 200 MPa / m. Calculate the velocity profile using solve_bvp for the
  situation that (a) both plates are stationary and (b) for the situation that
  the upper plate is stationary and the bottom plate is moving at 10 m/s in the
  opposite direction as the pressure drop; plot these together on the same plot.

- [2018-10-01 Mon] in nla-compressibility the temperature of the gas is 450 K.
