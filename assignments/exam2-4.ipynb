The cost of the top/bottom of the can is \\\\$0.025 / cm<sup>2</sup>, and the cost of the sides is \\\\$0.043 / cm<sup>2</sup>. If we require a volume of 355 cm<sup>3</sup>, what is the optimal length and diameter to minimize the cost of the can?\n\nHint: $L = 4 V / \\pi / D^2$. Then, you can formulate the total cost as a function of only $D$.\n\nShow that your solution is a minimum, and compute the cost of the can.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"exam2-4","POINTS":"2","CATEGORY":"exam-2","RUBRIC":"default","RUBRIC_CATEGORIES":"technical, presentation","RUBRIC_WEIGHTS":"0.8, 0.2","DUEDATE":"2018-10-24 10:20:00","GRADER":"John Kitchin"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
