To cool both the container and the liquid to room temperature (70 °F, the container is immersed in a bath at 32°F.  Balancing the rate of change of energy storage between the liquid and the container with the rate of convective heat transfer (liquid – container and container – bath) leads to a coupled system of equations, where L is the temperature of the liquid and C is the temperature of the container.  Using the parameters given, plot the temperature of the liquid and the container as a function of time.\n\n$\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{A_i h}{\\rho_1 c_{p1} V_1}(C - L)$\n\n$\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{A_o h}{\\rho_2 c_{p2} V_2}(32-C) + \\frac{A_i h}{\\rho_2 c_{p2} V_2}(L-C)$\n\n||Liquid (1)|Container (2)|\n|---\n|Mass density [lbm/ft3]|62|139|\n|Specific heat [Btu/lbmF]|1.00|0.2|\n|Volume [ft3]|0.03|0.003|\n\n$A_i=0.4$ ft<sup>2</sup> and $A_o=0.5$ ft<sup>2</sup>\nAssume $h = 8.8$ Btu/hr ft<sup>3</sup> °F\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n# At what time should the container be removed for the liquid inside it to be at room temperature (70 °F)?
