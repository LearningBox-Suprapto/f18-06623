For example, consider $f(x) = x e^{-x}$, and you seek to find the value of $x$ that makes this function equal to 0.1. One way to do this is to use a nonlinear algebra solver. In this problem, we will consider a way to solve it by integrating a differential equation.\n\nThe idea is to derive the derivative of the function, $f'(x)$, and then solve the initial value problem with an event function that finds the solution you want.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n# First plot the function\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["You should plot the function to see if there is a solution.
